# ML_Case_Study
### About Dataset -
#### Context: 
While exploring the Aerial Bombing Operations of World War II and recalling that the D-Day landings were nearly postponed due to poor weather, I sought out weather reports from the period to compare with missions in the bombing operations dataset. 
#### Content:
The dataset contains information on weather conditions recorded each day at various weather stations around the world. Information includes precipitation, snowfall, temperatures, wind speed, and whether the day included thunderstorms or other poor weather conditions.
#### Inspiration: 
This dataset is mostly to assist with the analysis of the Aerial Bombing Operations dataset.
#### Goal or Objective:
The Goal or the objective of this study is to predict the max and min temp based on several parameters and represent it in a visual form.
